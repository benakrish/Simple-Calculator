1. Intro
________________________

	The "Calculator" program generates a resizable window
	1containing a basic calculator, which can perform simple
	operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
	and division. It can handle negative numbers and decimals,
	and can also perform the square root function.
	
	The window is resizable and remains usable at any size
	chosen by the user.
	
	Thank you for checking out my Calculator, designed in
	Java using Swing. This is my first project designing
	GUIs using Java and I wanted to go for something that
	looks and feels good. This readme.txt file will explain
	some of my motivations for this project, what I did to
	complete it, and what I've learned as a result.

2. About the Creator
________________________

	Hi, my name is Ben Akrish. I am a finance student at
	the University of Washington, Seattle. I have recently
	become very fond of coding after learning from some of
	the best faculty in the world at my university. However,
	I was sad to see that there was no time to approach visual
	coding aspects during my two introductory Java courses.
	Hence, I took it upon myself to learn the basics.
	
	I'm not particularly interested in visual coding alone,
	but I believe that user interfaces must be sleek; this
	is essential to success in coding, but also in business 
	and in life. Presentation is everything. Plus, it's a lot 
	of fun to see something come to life visually.
	
	I am interested in reading and exercise, and I pursue a 
	variety of projects in my free time (of which I have 
	little). I'm excited to collaborate with others, and I am 
	particularly interested in developments in the 
	cryptocurrency space.
	
	Let there be no more delay. I assume that most viewing this
	project are new to visual coding in Java just as I am, so
	I'll get right to my takeaways. I hope that my experience
	with this project can help others on a similar path.
	
3. Motivations
________________________

	I quickly noticed when I started coding in Java that there
	is a bit of a gap between creating visible projects from
	creating visibly-simple text-only programs. While these
	are great and all, this project serves as a milestone in
	my coding journey. Creating a GUI from scratch that also
	performs calculations commands skill in multiple aspects
	of Java programming. Understandings across multiple parts
	must be combined to complete this program.
	
	I also wanted a calculator that I could quickly open up
	from my desktop and actually use. This calculator will 
	serve that purpose well. Of course, these already exist,
	but it feels about 34% cooler to use a calculator that you
	designed yourself.

4. Methods
________________________

	I used Swing to create this program's display in Java.
	It uses a GridBagLayout, which is how it is so easily
	resizable and maintains proportions.
	
	The actual calculations for the calculator took me
	longer to create, surprisingly. These are handled
	within a separate class called "CalculatorManager."
	To keep my code extremely clean, I used three classes
	(including "main") to break everything up into
	calculations, display, and main. Main handles the 
	flow of data between the user and the computer.	

5. What I've Learned
________________________

	From this project, I mostly learned to never give up.
	But more than that, I figured out a lot of nuanced 
	ways of solving problems in Swing. Sometimes, getting
	around an issue is best done by simply using another
	method. Swing is perfect for this, as there are a
	multiplicity of ways to solve every problem.
	
	As any programmer should, I frequently consulted 
	different locations on Google for help resolving minor
	issues. Since this was my first time using Swing, I
	watched a tutorial for exposure to the subject before
	diving in, and I believe that this tutorial was
	instrumental. However, working through the problem
	firsthand was the most concrete source of learning,
	and this project solidified the importance of working at
	a problem instead of locking myself into a state of
	perpetual "analysis paralysis."

6. Contribution Guidelines
________________________

	I mostly view this calculator as a completed project.
	While there may be some bugs, it exists mostly for me to
	improve as a programmer. I am aware of a few of the small
	bugs, especially those that appear as the user input
	reaches very high numbers. This does not bother me and
	these are very easy fixes. The project is currently in 
	beta simply to allow me some room to fix these later if 
	I ever feel so inclined.
	
	If you would like to add to this project by increasing 
	its features, that would be really cool; feel free to do
	so. I would love to see what others can do to make this
	calculator more interactive and useful.
